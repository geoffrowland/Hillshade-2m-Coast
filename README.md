The SurfZone Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was produced in 2014 to model the coastal zone post the 2013/2014 UK winter storms. Using the best available LIDAR and near-shore multibeam SONAR bathymetry available at the time, it is the best currently available Digital Elevation Model (DEM) covering the inter-tidal zone produced by the Environment Agency.

The SurfZone DEM 2014 data is freely available to use under the Open Government Licence. 

Bathymetric Data was supplied by the Environment Agency and the National Network of Regional Coastal Monitoring Programmes of England, downloaded from the Channel Coastal Observatory (www.channelcoast.org) website.
